# JazzChordRecognition

Course project for DT2470 Music Informatics at KTH

### Summary 

In this project I investigated if it's possible to retrieve chord symbols from chroma features by learning from large amounts of annotated data. The dataset used consists of chroma features and chord annotations for 112 jazz songs. I used two different methods: similarity measurement and Hidden Markov Models.
